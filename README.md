# Stop ðŸ˜ˆ Loss Protocol

## Project Description

ðŸ˜ˆ The Stoploss Protocol gives you more control over the risk you are taking when participating in DeFi. It brings Stop-loss and take-profit orders in DeFi, one of the essential features of financial systems, without taking custody of the funds involved.

The first version of the Stoploss Protocol, developped during Ethonline hackathon, focuses on insuring Liquidity Providers on Uniswap against Impermanent Loss (IL).
Provide Liquidity, Set your maximum amount of IL, the protocol guarantees you to exit your LP position when needed.

Find below our demo for Ethonline :)

### Why AMMs?

Impermanent losses for LPs is recognized in the industry as the biggest problem of AMMs: "*Impermanent loss is by far one of the biggest detriments to the success of DEXs like Uniswap."* â€” Lucas and Cooper

AMM are still new and the understanding of Impermanent Loss is reserved for experts. By insuring LP activities, we hope to help new commers to experiment with Liquidity Proving in a safer environment. 

We are also providing a new DeFi primitive, that we are sure DeFi individuals and protocols will leverage for new sophisticated strategies.

### Stoploss.finance Alpha specs

Most LPs supplying liquidity to AMMs such as Uniswap suffer from Impermanent losses. [StopLoss.finance](http://stoploss.Finance) will allow LPs to limit those losses via a decentralized StopLoss protocol that triggers automated liquidations based on users' maximum acceptable loss.
The alpha version will allow users on [https://kovan.stoploss.finance](http://kovan.stoploss.finance)  to: 
1. Provide Liquidity to the 4 [UNI Pools](https://app.uniswap.org/#/uni) [(](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/)[ETH/USDT](https://uniswap.info/pair/0x0d4a11d5eeaac28ec3f61d100daf4d40471f1852), [ETH/USDC,](https://uniswap.info/pair/0xb4e16d0168e52d35cacd2c6185b44281ec28c9dc) [ETH/DAI](https://uniswap.info/pair/0xa478c2975ab1ea89e8196811f51a7b7ade33eb11) & [ETH/WBTC](https://uniswap.info/pair/0xbb2b8038a1640196fbe3e38816f3e67cba72d940))
2. Set a stop loss order to limit impermanent losses with a guaranteed amount in Tokens

Example: 

- Provide 700 DAI as liquidity in the ETH/DAI pool
- Place a stop-loss order guaranteeing 500 DAI
- If the liquidity of the LP gets close to 500 DAI (500+X%), LP position will get liquidated, 500 DAI will be sent to the LP.*

OR For the most bullish of us

- Provide 3 ETH in the ETH/DAI pool
- Place a stop-loss order guaranteeing 2 ETH
- If the liquidity of the LP gets close to 2ETH (2ETH+X%), LP position will get liquidated, 2ETH DAI will be sent to the LP.*

**The agent in charge of liquidating the position will get the X%*
